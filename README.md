# dice-game

I'm using the dice game within "The Complete Javascript Course 2022 as an example.  I am building this game from the example but NOT coding along with the example.  I built the structure from looking at the example and determining what is the best way to code it out using the skills I have gained and when stuck, using google for reference.
